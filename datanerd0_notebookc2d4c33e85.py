# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed

# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python

# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 



import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)



import numpy as np # linear algebra



# plot lib

import matplotlib as plt

import seaborn as sns



#ml lib

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory



from subprocess import check_output

print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))



# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
train_df = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')

test_df = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')
train_df.head()
train_df.drop(['Survived'],axis=1).head()

#train_X = train_df.

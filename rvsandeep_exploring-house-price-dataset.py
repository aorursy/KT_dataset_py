# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python

# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 



import numpy as np # linear algebra

import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)



# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import seaborn as sns

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt



from subprocess import check_output

print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))



# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
df = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')

list(df)
sns.boxplot(x="MSSubClass", y="SalePrice", data=df);
sns.countplot(x="MSSubClass", data=df, palette="Greens_d");

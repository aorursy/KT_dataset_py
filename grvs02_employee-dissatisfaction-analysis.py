'''In this project, we'll clean and analyze exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)}) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) body of the Queensland government in Australia.

We'll pretend our stakeholders want us to combine the results for both surveys to answer the following question:



Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?'''

'''We can make the following observations based on the work above:



The dete_survey dataframe contains 'Not Stated' values that indicate values are missing, but they aren't represented as  NaN.

Both the dete_survey and tafe_survey contain many columns that we don't need to complete our analysis.

Each dataframe contains many of the same columns, but the column names are different.

There are multiple columns/answers that indicate an employee resigned because they were dissatisfied.

Identify Missing Values and Drop Unneccessary Columns

First, we'll correct the Not Stated values and drop some of the columns we don't need for our analysis.'''

'''Below are our findings:



The years in both dataframes don't completely align. The tafe_survey_updated dataframe contains some cease dates in 2009, but the dete_survey_updated dataframe does not. The tafe_survey_updated dataframe also contains many more cease dates in 2010 than the dete_survey_updaed dataframe. Since we aren't concerned with analyzing the results by year, we'll leave them as is.

Create a New Column

Since our end goal is to answer the question below, we need a column containing the length of time an employee spent in their workplace, or years of service, in both dataframes.



End goal: Are employees who have only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been at the job longer?

The tafe_resignations dataframe already contains a "service" column, which we renamed to institute_service.



Below, we calculate the years of service in the dete_survey_updated dataframe by subtracting the dete_start_date from the cease_date and create a new column named institute_service.'''
# Calculate the length of time an employee spent in their respective workplace and create a new column

dete_resignations['institute_service'] = dete_resignations['cease_date'] - dete_resignations['dete_start_date']



# Quick check of the result

dete_resignations['institute_service'].head()
'''Identify Dissatisfied EmployeesÂ¶

Next, we'll identify any employees who resigned because they were dissatisfied. Below are the columns we'll use to categorize employees as "dissatisfied" from each dataframe:



tafe_survey_updated:

Contributing Factors. Dissatisfaction

Contributing Factors. Job Dissatisfaction

dafe_survey_updated:

job_dissatisfaction

dissatisfaction_with_the_department

physical_work_environment

lack_of_recognition

lack_of_job_security

work_location

employment_conditions

work_life_balance

workload



If the employee indicated any of the factors above caused them to resign, we'll mark them as dissatisfied in a new column. After our changes, the new dissatisfied column will contain just the following values:



True: indicates a person resigned because they were dissatisfied in some way

False: indicates a person resigned because of a reason other than dissatisfaction with the job

NaN: indicates the value is missing'''


# Check the unique values

tafe_resignations['Contributing Factors. Dissatisfaction'].value_counts()


# Check the unique values

tafe_resignations['Contributing Factors. Job Dissatisfaction'].value_counts()
# Update the values in the contributing factors columns to be either True, False, or NaN

def update_vals(x):

    if x == '-':

        return False

    elif pd.isnull(x):

        return np.nan

    else:

        return True

tafe_resignations['dissatisfied'] = tafe_resignations[['Contributing Factors. Dissatisfaction', 'Contributing Factors. Job Dissatisfaction']].applymap(update_vals).any(1, skipna=False)

tafe_resignations_up = tafe_resignations.copy()



# Check the unique values after the updates

tafe_resignations_up['dissatisfied'].value_counts(dropna=False)
# Update the values in columns related to dissatisfaction to be either True, False, or NaN

dete_resignations['dissatisfied'] = dete_resignations[['job_dissatisfaction',

       'dissatisfaction_with_the_department', 'physical_work_environment',

       'lack_of_recognition', 'lack_of_job_security', 'work_location',

       'employment_conditions', 'work_life_balance',

       'workload']].any(1, skipna=False)

dete_resignations_up = dete_resignations.copy()

dete_resignations_up['dissatisfied'].value_counts(dropna=False)


'''Combining the Data

Below, we'll add an institute column so that we can differentiate the data from each survey after we combine them. Then, we'll combine the dataframes and drop any remaining columns we don't need.'''
# Add an institute column

dete_resignations_up['institute'] = 'DETE'

tafe_resignations_up['institute'] = 'TAFE'
# Combine the dataframes

combined = pd.concat([dete_resignations_up, tafe_resignations_up], ignore_index=True)



# Verify the number of non null values in each column

combined.notnull().sum().sort_values()
# Drop columns with less than 500 non null values

combined_updated = combined.dropna(thresh = 500, axis =1).copy()
'''Clean the Service Column

Next, we'll clean the institute_service column and categorize employees according to the following definitions:



New: Less than 3 years in the workplace

Experienced: 3-6 years in the workplace

Established: 7-10 years in the workplace

Veteran: 11 or more years in the workplace

Our analysis is based on this article, which makes the argument that understanding employee's needs according to career stage instead of age is more effective.'''


# Check the unique values

combined_updated['institute_service'].value_counts(dropna=False)


# Extract the years of service and convert the type to float

combined_updated['institute_service_up'] = combined_updated['institute_service'].astype('str').str.extract(r'(\d+)')

combined_updated['institute_service_up'] = combined_updated['institute_service_up'].astype('float')



# Check the years extracted are correct

combined_updated['institute_service_up'].value_counts()
# Convert years of service to categories

def transform_service(val):

    if val >= 11:

        return "Veteran"

    elif 7 <= val < 11:

        return "Established"

    elif 3 <= val < 7:

        return "Experienced"

    elif pd.isnull(val):

        return np.nan

    else:

        return "New"

combined_updated['service_cat'] = combined_updated['institute_service_up'].apply(transform_service)



# Quick check of the update

combined_updated['service_cat'].value_counts()
'''Perform Some Initial AnalysisÂ¶

Finally, we'll replace the missing values in the dissatisfied column with the most frequent value, False. Then, we'll calculate the percentage of employees who resigned due to dissatisfaction in each service_cat group and plot the results.



Note that since we still have additional missing values left to deal with, this is meant to be an initial introduction to the analysis, not the final analysis.'''
# Verify the unique values

combined_updated['dissatisfied'].value_counts(dropna=False)
# Replace missing values with the most frequent value, False

combined_updated['dissatisfied'] = combined_updated['dissatisfied'].fillna(False)
# Calculate the percentage of employees who resigned due to dissatisfaction in each category

dis_pct = combined_updated.pivot_table(index='service_cat', values='dissatisfied')



# Plot the results

%matplotlib inline

dis_pct.plot(kind='bar', rot=30)





'''From the initial analysis above, we can tentatively conclude that employees with 7 or more years of service are more likely to resign due to some kind of dissatisfaction with the job than employees with less than 7 years of service. However, we need to handle the rest of the missing data to finalize our analysis.'''

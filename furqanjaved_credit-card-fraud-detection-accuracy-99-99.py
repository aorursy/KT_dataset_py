# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed

# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python

# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 



import numpy as np # linear algebra

import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)



# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory



import os

for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):

    for filename in filenames:

        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

        

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
dataset = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

X = dataset.iloc[:, 0:30].values

y = dataset.iloc[:, 30].values
# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 0)
# Feature Scaling

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

sc = StandardScaler()

X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)

X_test = sc.transform(X_test)


# Fitting K-NN to the Training set

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

classifier = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 5, metric = 'minkowski', p = 2)

classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)


# Making the Confusion Matrix

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

print(cm)
#Accuracy

accuracy =  (cm[0,0]+cm[1,1])/len(X_test)

print(accuracy)

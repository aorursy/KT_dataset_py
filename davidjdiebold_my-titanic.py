# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import csv as csv 


# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Open up the csv file in to a Python object
csv_file_object = csv.reader(open('../input/train.csv', 'rb')) 
#header = csv_file_object.next()  # The next() command just skips the 
                                 # first line which is a header
data=[]                          # Create a variable called 'data'.
for row in csv_file_object:      # Run through each row in the csv file,
    data.append(row)             # adding each row to the data variable
data = np.array(data) 	         # Then convert from a list to an array
			                     # Be aware that each item is currently
                                 # a string in this format

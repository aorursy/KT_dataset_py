# this is a basic example to show how to loop through a list and print

nonsense = ['aba', 'daba', 'doo']

# now we define our for loop

# and pull the list nonsense

# and associate it with non

for non in nonsense:

    print(non)
# here is a version with no comments 

monsters = ['frankenstein', 'werewolf', 'dracula']

for monster in monsters:

    print(monster)

for monster in monsters:

    print(f"{monster.title()} is scary when angry")

for monster in monsters:

    print(f"{monster.title()} is scary when angry")

    print(f"Fear not, the {monster.title()} slayer will help you!")

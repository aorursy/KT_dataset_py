  <p><b>Count</b>: The plot above shows that jupyter is most used IDE followed by RStudio, Notepad++, Pycharm and Sublime Text. It beats all of them by a large margin. Both Jupyter and Rstudio provide excellent support for analysis and visualization which explains their large user base. Rstudio and Jupyter are mainly developed for R and Python respectively which are most preferred languages for data science. Despite being launched in 2014 well after Rsutdio(2011), Pycharm(2010) and Sublime text(2008), Jupyter project has gained large popularity among users. </p>
    <p><b>Age</b>: Jupyter it at the top as most used IDE in all age groups. The second and third position differ for different age groups. The new entrants( age: 18-24) are still testing IDEs and have roughly uniform user base across the popular IDEs. The next group( age: 25-34) is showing a slight preference for Rstudio and Notepad++ with Pycharm in close distance. The next two groups(age: 35-44, age: 45-54) clearly show preference for Rstudio and Notepad++.  The other groups(age: 55-69, age: 70+) prefer Rstudio as a second choice, though third preference is not obvious as MATLAB, Visual Studio and Notepad++ are close.</p>
    <p><b>Country</b>: Jupyter is still on the top in every country, though Rstudio and pyCharm are very close to matching its user base in the USA and China respectively. In Brazil, we see Rstudio, Notepad++, Sublime text and Visual studio code are fighting for 2nd and 3rd preference. Its noteworthy that Rstudio has a very low preference among Chinese and Russian data scientists and pyCharm is their second preference. The Spyder IDE has a sizable base among Indians.</p>
    <p><b>Education</b>: Again, we see Jupyter as a top preference among all user groups based on the level of education. As we move lower to higher levels of education the user base for RStudio is increasing while the opposite is true for pyCharm and Visual Studio. The Matlab IDE is the third preference for users with a doctoral degree. The Notepad++ has a sizable base among all user groups.</p>
    <p><b>Degree Major</b>: Jupyter is the first choice for IDE among users of all groups, though Rstudio is not behind among users from Business, Maths & Stats and Social sciences. The vast number of statistics packages in CRAN explains the large user base of RSutdio in these communities. The Second and third choice varies with the user group. The computer science and IT users prefer pyCharm and Notepad++ while Engineering(non-comp) prefer RStudio and MATLAB.</p>
    <p><b>Role</b>: Jupyter is still most loved and preferred IDE for most of the user groups except for Statisticians & Data analysts who prefer RStudio. The 2nd and 3rd choice for IDE revolves around Pycharm, Notepad++, RStudio and Visual studio code among most of the user groups. The MATLAB ide has a good presence among research-related roles.</p>
    <p><b>Industry</b>: Jupyter has overwhelming support for top IDE from all user groups. The tussle over 2nd and 3rd are dominated by mostly RStudio, Notepad++  and sometimes Pycharm. The Matlab is supported mostly by users in academic and defense role.</p>
    <p><b>Salary</b>: Once again, jupyter beats every IDE in the race for top IDE among every salary group. As the salary increases share of RStudio users is increasing. The high salary groups prefer RStudio as their second IDE while the opposite is true for Notepad++.</p>
    <p><b>Experience</b>: The plot shows that jupyter is the most used IDE among all experience groups. Among, all groups Rstudio stands out as the second choice for IDE. The Notepad++ is the next choice in every group except the two seniormost groups. The visual studio's share is increasing as the experience increases while the reverse is true for sublime text.</p>

    <p><b>Count</b>: It seems that most of the data scientists don't use a notebook platform for data analysis and visualization. Next in the line is Kaggle kernels followed by Jupyterhub/binder, Google Colab, Azure Notebook, Google cloud Datalab and others. Though Kaggle kernels(July 2017) and Google's Colab(Nov 2017) were launched later than Azure notebooks(2016) & Google cloud datalab(June 2016), both have managed to attract a larger user base.The primary reason for the success of Kaggle kernels, Jupyterhub and Colab is that they don't require a Credit card or billing registration.</p>
    <p><b>Age</b>: The share of Kaggle kernels decreases as we move towards higher age groups and same are true for Colab and Jupyterhub. It is evident from the plot that higher age groups have a small user base for all notebook platforms. The percentage of users who don't use notebooks is bigger for higher age groups.</p>
    <p><b>Country</b>: For almost every country the share of None is higher than any notebook platform barring India and Brazil. The Kaggle kernel is the top choice for notebook platform for every country except the USA where it is matched by Jupyterhub. Colab's share is low in America and China when compared to other countries.</p> 
    <p><b>Education</b>: The notebook users from all education groups prefer Kaggle platform followed by Jupyterhub and google's Colab. The users show small preference to Azure notebook and Datalab.</p>
    <p><b>Degree Major</b>: The users from most of the degree groups prefer not to use a notebook platform except for computer science who equally prefer both options Kaggle platform and not using a notebook. The second choice for a notebook platform is Jupyterhub followed by Colab in the third position. The Datalab from Google has a significant user base in fine arts group.</p>
    <p><b>Role</b>: Again, Majority prefers to not use a notebook platform barring few exceptions like users in Data journalist and Scientist role. The data journalists are more likely to use Jupyterhub and azure notebooks when compared to other roles. The first choice for notebook platform is a tie between Jupyterhub and Kaggle kernels as some roles prefer Kaggle while others prefer Jupyterhub. The third choice is google's Colab except for data engineers and journalists.</p>
    <p><b>Industry</b>: Most of the users in a group prefer not to use a notebook platform. The notebook platform users give preference to Kaggle kernel over other platforms in almost all industrial groups with few exceptions like energy/mining, student and non-profit service. The third preference goes to google Colab.</p>
    <p><b>Salary</b>: Majority of users don't use notebook platforms. The share of kaggle usersis lower in high income groups when compared to lower income groups.</p>
    <p><b>Experience</b>: The users who prefer not to use a notebook platform have a majority in all experience levels. We can see that the share of Kaggle users decreases as we move to higher experience levels while the reverse is true for None. The group with 20-25 years of experience have a significant share of azure notebooks users.</p>

    <p><b>Count</b>: Amazon web services leads in the share for cloud computing services. Also, a large number of users haven't used a cloud provider yet. AWS, GCP, and Azure are clearly leading the cloud computing services market. AWS(2006) was the first one to launch cloud services followed by Google(2008), IBM(2009), Microsoft(2010), and Alibaba(2016). Despite being only two years older than others, AWS has managed to stay ahead by a large margin. Though, only 2 years old Alibaba is moving fast to overtake IBM.</p>
    <p><b>Age</b>: AWS is the leader in providing cloud-based services in all age groups though users having age 18-24 years almost equally prefer google cloud and AWS. The share of Google cloud in every age group is more or less same while the share of AWS & Azure increases when we move up from the lowest age group. The share of Alibaba cloud decreases as we move to up to higher age levels.</p>
    <p><b>Country</b>: AWS is the most preferred cloud service provider for all countries except China where Alibaba is sought over the others. Alibaba has a very small presence in other countries. The USA has the lowest percentage of users not opting for cloud providers. Also, AWS margin over others in the USA indicates that the gain in cloud users percentage has been captured mostly by AWS.</p>
    <p><b>Education</b>: The distribution of cloud users is pretty much same for the major cloud providers in all groups. AWS leads the race with GCP in second place closely followed by Azure in all education groups.</p>
    <p><b>Degree Major</b>: We see that AWS is at the top of cloud providers and its user base is sometimes close(Social sciences) and even beats(Fine arts, Humanities) the nonusers percentage. GCP and Azure are the first and second runner-ups respectively. The humanities group has the highest percentage of AWS users among all the degree groups.</p>
    <p><b>Role</b>: The Students, Statisticians, Marketing analysts & not employed have a very large share (>40%) of users who don't use a cloud provider. The users with senior roles and roles related to computer science are more likely to use cloud service provider as evident from the heatmap. Database engineers prefer both AWS and Azure over GCP by a large margin. AWS is the most preferred cloud service provider.</p>
    <p><b>Industry</b>: AWS has an overwhelmingly large presence among users who work in Internet-based sales or services. The academicians and student have a high probability of not using a cloud provider when compared to other industries. AWS is the leading cloud service provider followed by GCP in some industries and Azure in others.</p>
    <p><b>Salary</b>: We can see that as the salary increases a user is more likely to opt for a cloud service provider for his needs. The share of AWS and Azure increases with rising salary while GCP's share is more or less same. Also, the margin between AWS and other service providers rises with an increase in salary.</p>
    <p><b>Experience</b>: AWS leads the race for best cloud service provider with GCP and Azure as first and second runner-up. The group with less than one year of experience have highest share among non users of cloud services when compared to other groups. The higher experience groups on an average prefer IBM cloud and Azure more than lower experience groups while opposite is true for AWS.</p>

    <p><b>Count</b>: Unlike tools and libraries, all the prominent data science languages are more than a decade old. Python was launched in 1991 while R in 2000 and SQL in the 1970s. Python is the most popular language by a large margin. SQL and R are next in line followed by C/C++, Java & others after a big dip.</p>
    <p><b>Age</b>: Python is the most preferred language by all groups. For second and third positions we have some interesting differences. The users in the youngest age group 18-24 yrs prefer C/C++ and Java. For other age groups, SQL is second most preferred language except for seniormost age group which prefers R. As we move to higher age groups the share of SQL, R and C# increases barring seniormost group where SQL decreases.</p>
    <p><b>Country</b>: Python is the most suitable language in every country group. C#/NET has a very low presence among Americans and Indians. Americans are pretty much settled with SQL as 2nd and R as 3rd most suitable language. Except for Russia and China R is the 3rd most preferred language in all groups. Matlab has a sizable presence among Chinese.</p>
    <p><b>Education</b>: Python is the first choice for data scientists in every group. SQL is in the second place for all the groups except doctoral degree. The third preference differs for each group. The share of R users increases as the level of education rises.</p>

Both R and STATA have excellent support for statistics which explains their strong user base among statisticians. C++ and MATLAB have good support among research roles. In most of the groups 2nd and 3rd preference are divided among R and SQL, though sometimes C++, Java, MATLAB and Javascript stake their claim.</p>
    <p><b>Industry</b>: Python is sitting at the top of in every group. The 2nd and 3rd most suitable language title is divided among R and SQL with few exceptions like Defense and academics where honor goes to C++ and MATLAB. STATA finds its use in the Insurance industry. Javascript has a sizable base in the Online service industry.</p>
    <p><b>Salary</b>: Python is the most preferred language in all groups, though its share decreases as we move to higher income groups. Next in line is SQL followed by R in all groups except the lowest salary band where Java and C++ also have a sizable base.</p>
    <p><b>Experience</b>: Python is the most preferred language and by a large margin in all experience levels, though its share is decreasing as we move towards higher experience levels. C#'s share shows an increasing trend as we go up in experience levels. The second most preferred language is SQL followed by R.</p>

    <p><b>Count</b>: Scikit-Learn is the most popular package for machine learning framework followed by Tensorflow and Keras. Scikit and Caret are old horses launched in 2007 and still going strong. Moving a bit further in the timeline we have H2O(2011), Apache spark (2012), Caffe(2014) and xgboost(2014). Except Caffe all other are general machine learning frameworks which could be one of the reasons why it has the slowest growth among these packages. In the next few years we have Keras(2015), Tensorflow(2015), CNTK(2016), PyTorch(2016), Lightgbm(April 2017), and Fastai(nov 2017). Tensorflow is the fastest gainer while CNTK is slowest.</p>
    <p><b>Age</b>: Scikit is the most preferred framework for machine learning followed by Tensorflow and Keras in all age groups except 70+ where Tensorflow beats scikit by a small margin. The 25-34 age group is the biggest user of machine learning frameworks. Pytorch share decreases as we move higher age groups while the reverse is true for randomForest</p>
    <p><b>Country</b>: Scikit is the first choice for ML framework in all countries except China where Tensorflow takes the lead. Catboost has the largest user base among Russians when compared to other countries which is logical since Catboost was developed by Yandex a Russian company. Also, Caret is least popular among Russians and Chinese probably due to low user base for R language as seen in earlier plots. Indians and Americans have the highest number of machine learning framework users.</p>
    <p><b>Education </b>: The top three positions are pretty much fixed in all groups with Scikit at the top followed by Tensorflow and Keras. The Master's degree holders are heaviest users of ml frameworks followed by Bachelors and PhDs.</p>
    <p><b>Degree Major</b>: Scikit leads the race for popular ML framework. The business, stats, and social sciences have a large share of randomForest users. Engineering(comp and non-comp) are the top users of machine learning frameworks. </p>
    <p><b>Role</b>: The salespersons have a large number of users among them who prefer not to use any ML framework. The users in analyst(business, data, and marketing) roles prefer randomForest after scikit. Scikit is still at the top and 2nd and 3rd place is occupied by Tensorflow and Keras in most of the groups. The students and data scientists are the topmost users of machine learning frameworks.</p>
    <p><b>Industry</b>: The top three positions are pretty much fixed in all groups with Scikit at the top followed by Tensorflow and Keras. The people working in Computer/Technology and Academia heavily use machine learning packages in their work.</p>
    <p><b>Salary</b>: We have the same three frameworks in the top positions and in the same order. The share of scikit decreases as we move to higher salary bands while the reverse is true for xgboost.</p>
    <p><b>Experience</b>: Again Scikit, Tensorflow and Keras occupy the top positions and in the same order. It is interesting to note that scikit and xgboost share decreases as we move towards higher experience levels. There is general downward trend in number of ml framework users as we move towards higher experience levels with group 5-10 being an exception.</p>

    <p><b>Count</b>: Matplotlib is as overwhelmingly popular visualization library followed by ggplot2 and seaborn which have the almost same share of users. Both Matplotlib(2008) and ggplot2(2008) are a decade old packages. Matplotlib is a python based library and ggplot2 is a visualization package for R language users. In the next batch, we have D3(2011), Seaborn(2012), Plotly(2012) and shiny(2012). Though Plotly, shiny and Seaborn were launched after D3 their user base is larger than D3. This could be possible because D3 is Javascript based library and javascript is not very popular among data practitioners as seen in earlier plots.</p>
    <p><b>Age</b>: The top 3 choices for Visualization are same for every age group with Matplotlib at the top followed by ggplot2 and seaborn. The user base of ggplot2 is increasing as we move to towards higher age bands while the reverse is true for Plotly and Seaborn.</p>
    <p><b>Country</b>: Matplotlib is the most popular visualization library in all countries especially China where is mighty popular. We see that pgplot2 has a low user base in Russia and China which is perfectly logical given low R user base in these countries. The share of Plotly is also very low in China when compared to other countries.</p>
    <p><b>Education</b>: The margin between matplotlib and ggplot2 decreases as we move towards higher education levels because of the decrease in matplotlib users and the increase in ggplot2 users. The Masters. Bachelors and PhDs constitute the major part of visualization packages and libraries users.</p>
    <p><b>Degree Major</b>: This plot is consistent with language plot. The groups which have good R user base are more likely to use GGplot2 and the same is true for python and Matplotlib & seaborn. Matplotlib is still good in most of the groups though ggplot2 beats it by a small margin in social sciences. Engineering(comp and non-comp) form the majority of visualization libraries users.</p>
    <p><b>Role</b>: Statisticians largely prefer R based packages like ggplot2 and shiny. The users in analyst based roles prefer both R and python based tools equally. Data scientist and analyst based roles are the primary users of visualization libraries.</p>
    <p><b>Industry</b>: Most of the groups prefer python based tools like Matplotlib and seaborn. The users working in Retails, Non-profit, and Insurance also like ggplot2 and shiny. Apart from computer/Technology, students and academicians are the primary users of vizualization libraries.</p>
    <p><b>Salary</b>: The gap between matplotlib and ggplot2 decreases as we move to higher salary levels. The share of D3 users show upward trend if we increase the salary. The lowest salary band and highest salary band users form the major part of vizualization users.</p> 
    <p><b>Experience</b>: As the experience level increases D3 & Shiny show upward trend while Seaborn shows negative trend. Matplotlib beats other packages at every experience level. The total number of responses at a experience level decreases as we move to higher levels of experience.</p>

<p><b>Count</b>: AWS EC2 beats its nearest competitor by a big difference which speaks of its domination in cloud computing markets. The popular methods for cloud computing are virtual servers and event -driven serverless computing and AWS is ahead in both services. Next in line is Google followed by Microsoft's azure with IBM far behind.</p>
<p><b>Age</b>: The share of users who haven't used a cloud computing product is highest in the lowermost age group. One reason for this effect could be the requirement of a valid credit card which is not available to students in countries like India. The AWS EC2 share is lowest in lowermost age groups when compared to other age groups. GCE share is more or less same in all groups. Azure share increases as the age level increases and eclipses GCE in some groups.</p>
<p><b>Country</b>: The share of users who don't use a cloud computing service is very high in Russia and China and lowest in America. Azure has the biggest presence in Russia and the lowest in China. Surprisingly GCE has the lowest share in America when compared to its share in other countries.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Degree Major</b>: It is surprising that the highest share of virtual server users is from non-science branches like Fine arts and Humanities. Also, the humanities group has the lowest percentage of users not using a cloud computing service.</p>
<p><b>Role</b>: We see a lot more users availing serverless computing service in this plot. Salesperson, Statisticians, Data analysts, software engineers, and data journalists roles are the most prominent users of serverless computing. The whole share of serverless computing is divided between AWS and Google with little going to Microsoft's Azure.</p>

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
import json 

reports =  ["ApkMetaReport", "ByteCodeReport/uris", "ByteCodeReport/class_names", "AssetReport", "VirusTotalReport"]
for report in reports:
    path = f'../input/malware_static/{report}/' 
    files = os.listdir(path)
    for file in files[:1]:
        fqn = path + file
        with open(fqn) as f:
            data = json.load(f)
            print(f'{report}: {data}\n')

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

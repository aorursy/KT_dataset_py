#a.	Print the first element of lst (this one has been completed for you)

#Exercise 2 (working with a string):
#a.	Print the first four characters of s
print(s[:4])
#b.	Using indexing, print the substring "test" from s
print(s[10:14])
#c.	Print the contents of s starting from the 27th character (H)

#d.	Print the last three characters of s

#A regression model that uses L1 regularization technique is called Lasso Regression and model which uses L2 is called Ridge Regression.

#The key difference between these two is the penalty term.



#The key difference between these techniques is that Lasso shrinks the less important featureâ€™s coefficient to zero thus, removing some feature altogether. So, this works well for feature selection in case we have a huge number of features.
lr.fit(x_train,y_train)
y_predict = lr.predict(x_test)

## Hence we can see our model created is predicting 83 % correct values 

## Now lets apply PCA and see if accuracy increases 
### Creating PCA such that it will explain 95 % of the variance

from sklearn.decomposition import PCA



sklearn_pca = PCA(n_components = 0.95)



sklearn_pca.fit(x_train)

## Transforming using PCA 



x_train_transformed = sklearn_pca.transform(x_train)

x_test_transformed = sklearn_pca.transform(x_test)
x_train_transformed.shape

x_test_transformed.shape
lr1.fit(x_train_transformed,y_train)
y_predict1 = lr1.predict(x_test_transformed)

accuracy1 = accuracy_score(y_predict1,y_test)
print(accuracy1)



## Thsis is the accuracy of the new model

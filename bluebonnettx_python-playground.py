### (F:)This section is added in the notebook by default.



# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed

# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python

# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 



import numpy as np # linear algebra

import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)



# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory



from subprocess import check_output

print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))



# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
# (F:) Here will be the structure of this notebook



# (1) Read in the training data



# (2) Build the model to predict



# (3) Calculate the bias between predictions and test data

    # Read in the test data



# (4) Visualize



# (5) Result and discussion

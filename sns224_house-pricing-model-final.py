# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Read the data

# pull data into target (y) and predictors (X)

# Create training predictors data
train_X = train[predictor_cols]

my_model = RandomForestRegressor()

# Read the test data

# Treat the test data in the same way as training data. In this case, pull same columns.
test_X = test[predictor_cols]
# Use the model to make predictions

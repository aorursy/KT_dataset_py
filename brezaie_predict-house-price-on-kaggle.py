# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

#import os
#for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
#    for filename in filenames:
#        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

# Path of the file to read. We changed the directory structure to simplify submitting to a competition

# The list of columns is stored in a variable called features

# The lines below shows how to save predictions in format used for competition scoring
# Just uncomment them.

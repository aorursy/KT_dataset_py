# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

#import numpy as np # linear algebra
#import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

#import os
#print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
#I'm new bee to Machine Learning. I have few questions to clarify with you all. If you don't mind could you please help me?
# I statred with Titanic data set. 

#1. For such question, are we plotting only for train data set??
#2. what is this feature engineering? what we do exactly there? 
#3. For Model fitting and predicting, why do you use only SVC,RF, Logitic reg, KNN,GaussianNM, and Decision tree ?
#4. For final submission why you use only Random Forest ?
#5. For such question how do we organize our solution? ( step by step). When we have a problem, I need to know how we organize (how to break down ) to reach for the final solution.

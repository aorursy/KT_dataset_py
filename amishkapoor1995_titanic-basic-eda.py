# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed

# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python

# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 



import numpy as np # importing numpy 

import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)



# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory



import os

print(os.listdir("../input"))

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # visualizations

import seaborn as sns # for more visualisations



# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
# reading training and test data

train.shape #understanding shape of the dataset â€“ there are 891 rows and 12 columns
train.info() #provides important information pertaining to the training data set



#Some of the important information is:

    #Age column has a lot of empty/NaN values, which we need to fill

    #Cabin colmn primarily contains Nan values and we will skip this column

    #There are 2 values in the Embarked column which are empty
train.isnull().sum() #this is telling us the exact number of values in each column which contain Nan values
#Computing the mean and median age

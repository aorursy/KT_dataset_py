# Create lists of numbers

nums = [22,21,12,49,13,63,59]

nums2 = [22,1,4,8,9,10,-1,-4,6,5,9,10,100,-3,-5,8,59,-4,5,2,-1,9,49,5,9,3,22,11,9,0,4,9,10,55,9,10,-2,4,8,9,119,128,92,-2,-48,48,28,29,48,45,76,94,11,0,2]
## Calculate the average of nums using a for loop

avg = 0

## Calculate the average of nums using index based looping

avg = 0

## Calculate standard deviation of nums using a loop

std = 0

## Find the first element in num2s where its previous two elements in the sequence add up to this element. Use a while loop.



### Declare tracker variables to track our progress during every iteration

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed

# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python

# For example, here's several helpful packages to load



import numpy as np # linear algebra

import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)



# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory



import os

for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):

    for filename in filenames:

        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))



# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 

# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session
#  install necessary packages

!pip install numpy pandas sklearn xgboost
# os packages

#  letâ€™s read the data into a DataFrame 



df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/parkinsons.data')

# head() <= Use for first 5 rows
# descrive the data



df.describe()
#  To know how many rows and cols and NA values



df.info()
#  shape of the dataset 



df.shape
#  get the all features except "status"



features = df.loc[:, df.columns != 'status'].values[:, 1:] # values use for array format







# get status values in array format



labels = df.loc[:, 'status'].values



# to know how many values for 1 and how many for 0 labeled status

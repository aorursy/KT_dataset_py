#Create a regular python dictionary

#Create a data frame and pass in the python dictionary as it's data

#Print our dataframe

#Add new columns after creating the dataframe

#Values added to column must match number of rows already in dataframe or it won't work

#Print our dataframe

#Read in the excel file given the file location

#Printing the whole thing too big to show all

# First 5 rows

# Last 5 rows

# Dimensions of table

# Column and Row info

# Various metrics of each column

#Access all Column Names

#Check for null values

# Access one column and get more info on just one column 

#Access a specific column and get it's max

#Access a specific column and get it's mean

#Counting distinct values in a column

#Return the index 3 (4th row)

#iloc will follow the row values so the 4th row is the 3rd index 

#loc will follow the index values so the 5th row is the 4th index 

#Find the index of the max loan, can return more than one value

#Given an index and a column name return the value

#Filter data by rent and store into a new variable

# Filter data by interest rate greater than 15.2

#Filter data by interest rate and total_pymnt

#Group by each value in the column and show it's size

#Returns a dictionary? of each group

#Access just one key

#Sort entire table given a column value, indexes mix up showing you can still access by original index

#Sort entire table given two column values, indexes mix up showing you can still access by original index

#Import another library which can read dataframes and visualize them

#Create a histogram of the interest rates

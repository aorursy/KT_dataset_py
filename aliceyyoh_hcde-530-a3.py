    # Since 'count' is actaully a string of text and not an integer, 
    # we need to turn it into an integer to store that number in the dictionary so we can use it.

# We need to format our text so that it can show both the text and an integer.
# But the print() function only takes strings and we have a string and an integer.
# To deal with this, we use the % sign to say what text goes where. In the example 
# below the %d indicates to put a decimal value in the middle of the sentence, and
# that decimal value - the length of 'girls' is indicated at the end of the function: len(girls)

# We did this for you at the end of the previous homework.
# It's a little weird to stuff numbers into sentences this way, but once you get 
# used to it, it's easy. You can do lots of other formatting like this.
# Here's an explanation of how it works: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-output-formatting/

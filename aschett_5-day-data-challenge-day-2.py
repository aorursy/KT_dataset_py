# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed

# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python

# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 



import numpy as np # linear algebra

import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

import seaborn as sns # Visualization



# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory



from subprocess import check_output

print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))



# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
df = pd.read_csv('../input/data_set_ALL_AML_independent.csv')

row = df['39']

row.describe() # Get a summary of the '39' row
sns.distplot(row, kde=False).set_title('Distribution of \'39\' Value')

base_text = "Classical conditioning (also known as Pavlovian or respondent conditioning) refers to a learning procedure in which a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a previously neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell). It also refers to the learning process that results from this pairing, through which the neutral stimulus comes to elicit a response (e.g. salivation) that is usually similar to the one elicited by the potent stimulus. Classical conditioning was first studied in detail by Ivan Pavlov, through experiments with dogs and published in 1897. During the Russian physiologists study of digestion, Pavlov observed that the dogs serving as his subjects drooled when they were being served meat. Together with operant conditioning, classical conditioning became the foundation of behaviorism, a school of psychology which was dominant in the mid-20th century and is still an important influence on the practice of psychological therapy and the study of animal behavior. Classical conditioning is a basic learning process, and its neural substrates are now beginning to be understood. Though it is sometimes hard to distinguish classical conditioning from other forms of associative learning (e.g. instrumental learning and human associative memory), a number of observations differentiate them, especially the contingencies whereby learning occurs."

target_7 = "The New School Movement Foundation in Oslo opened the first New School in Oslo Autumn 2004. The Foundation is the umbrella organisation for the New School Movement. The founder of the School is Mosse Jørgensen. The New School is a semi-private/semi-public (i.e. free), not for profit organisation owned by the parents of the children (primary and secondary school children). The movement behind the school traces its origins to the core of the historical establishment of research-based Pedagogics at the University of Jena in 1927 by Professor Peter Petersen. Pedagogy was then a novel science as a humanistic science within the University, Academic sector. The New school was precedented by a high school, The Research High School in Oslo, founded by Mosse Jørgensen in 1969, based on the same research and tenets as the New School of 2004 in Oslo, Norway. The movement behind is understood as the movement creating the Unity school reform in 1936 in Norway, and is associated with the international school reform-movement for a child friendly, child oriented school. This reform made the Norwegian school system to be the first in the World to found a national public educational system on the findings of the scientific research on the novel science of Pedagogy. That is a school that takes as its primary reasons the individual potential for practical and theoretical learning, communal responsibility and democratic skills. The New School is defined by the following parameters. (It is thought that scientific research on learning has shown that these principles makes the best conditions for education and learning):"

target_10 = "Planned economies contrast with command economies. A planned economy is an economic system in which the government controls and regulates production, distribution, prices, etc.[11] whereas a command economy necessarily has substantial public ownership of industry while also having this type of regulation.[12] Most of a command economy is organized in a top-down administrative model by a central authority, where decisions regarding investment and production output requirements are decided upon at the top in the chain of command, with little input from lower levels. Advocates of economic planning have sometimes been staunch critics of these command economies. For example, Leon Trotsky believed that those at the top of the chain of command, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operated without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy and who understand/respond to local conditions and changes in the economy, and therefore would be unable to effectively coordinate all economic activity.[13]"

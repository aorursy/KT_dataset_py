# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed

# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python

# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 



import numpy as np # linear algebra

import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

a=9

b=2

c=-8

# this is the test of the function abs,min, and max.

print(float(a)+b,"absolute of c",abs(c),c,min(a,b,c),max(a,b,c))

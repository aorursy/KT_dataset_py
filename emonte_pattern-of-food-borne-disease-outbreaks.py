# Foodborne Disease Outbreaks, 1998 - 2015

# 1. Has foodborne disease outbreaks gotten worse over the years? 2. Which month do they tend to occur the most? 

# 3. Which state of the US do they appear the most frequently?



# Has foodborne disease outbreaks gotten worse over the years? And which month do they tend to occur the most, and what state of 

# the United States do they appear more frequently? Thanks to the public health agencies that operate in all 50 states for 

# investigating outbreaks and gathering all this data from 1998 through 2015 and submitting it to the Centers for Disease Control 

# and Prevention (CDC). We will be able to display a clearer picture and pattern for foodborne disease outbreaks. A foodborne 

# disease outbreak is considered an outbreak when two or more people get the same illness after ingestion of a common food/liquid

# and epidemiological analysis implicates the food as the source of the illness, according to the CDC.

# As it can be seen on this graph, the trend of foodborne illnesses has decreased overall since 1998. Significant drop is from 

# 2008 - 2009 but now seems to be steady at the 800 - 900 cases ranges. Looking at this data, one can come to the conclusion that 

# foodborne diseases are occurring less frequently.  After my research, I would have to agree, but still skeptical. Reasoning

# behind that is because most foodborne infections go undiagnosed and unreported, either because the sick person doesn't see a

# doctor(that's me all the time), or the doctor doesn???t made a specific diagnoses according to the 

# CDC. 



# The data shows the CDC and FDA(food and drug administration) that foodborne illnesses is decreasing and which months its at its

# highest and which states it affects the populace more. But little information as to why the data displays it. Gathering data on 

# the after match of regulations and policies that were created by the FDA could explain what impact they have or don't have.
df.isnull().sum()
# data anaylsis quality as you can tell from this function is missing a lot of data from ingredients of food that were the

# cause of illinesses. Also, missing serotype(classification of a bacteria) and Genotype(genetic trait). Both of these better

# classify what exactly disease caused the outbreak illnesses. I felt it best to graph what had the least amount of null data

# points, which was illnesses, year, month, and state.

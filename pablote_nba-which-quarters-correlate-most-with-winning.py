# Each pair of rows is equivalent, but reversing the first and second teams.
# Remove each second row to avoid this "duplicated" (mirrored) data.

## This comment is correct, but the technique used to remove the duplicate rows needs examination.
## The reason that there are 2 rows per game is to give the ability to search for games from a team's perspective.
## I will give some examples below on some different techniques for eliminating duplicate data.

for i in range(1, 6):
  df["ptsDiff%s" % i] = df["teamPTS%s" % i] - df["opptPTS%s" % i]
df["teamWin"] = (df["teamPTS"] > df["opptPTS"]).apply(lambda x: x and 1.0 or -1.0)
df["wentToOT"] = (df["teamPTS5"] + df["opptPTS5"]) > 0

#print (df.shape)
#print (df.loc[0, :])
## Let's start by including all rows
# df = df.iloc[::2, :].reset_index(drop = True)

## We can eliminate overtime games for now to reduce complexity.

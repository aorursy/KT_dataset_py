My Parents and My Teachers

Ever since the lockdown started, I feel lonely at home.
I do have a brother but soon realized that talking to a person
or doing the same thing consistently can get monotonous.
Sometimes, I even feel that it would be better to go to school,
which a month-back I could not have thought of in a million
years.At my house, both my parents are doctors. Not that they do
not have holidays, they do! Somehow, the holidays do not
seem enough.My parents are treating COVID-19 patients and often discuss their healthcare. 
At times, I nd their conversations scary and mom calms me down by saying this will end soon.
Yet, I am hardly convinced with her explanations. In the little time that I get to talk to 
my friends, we discuss the current situation due to pandemic and its advantages, especially 
on the environment, as us human beings are in lockdown.
A few days ago, when my father and I were sitting in the balcony at night I looked up in the
sky and saw a lot more stars than I usually get to see. Even my mom told me that Yamuna
river is getting cleaner amidst the lockdown.
I also feel that my friends have their parents at home, spending quality time with them and
all having fun times, together. While they have fun, my parents are at the hospital treating
patients and, of course, this is something that makes me very proud. Still, it is not the same
as having them at home.
However, the advantage of not having parents at home is that I do not have to do any work
until they are back. A few weeks ago, I panicked thinking that I would not get to celebrate my
birthday on its due date, just as it was not celebrated the previous three consecutive years on
the birthday day, since my parents were busy treating patients of either typhoid, pneumonia
or dengue. A sigh of relief, this year it does not matter that much as long as my family and I
are safe.
I am also anxious about school; I hope that they do not take away our summer holidays to
make up for the missed school days. I always enjoyed attending Bharatanatyam dance
classes but now, due to the lockdown, we have these classes on Zoom, which I can only
imagine, must be hard for the teacher as she tries to make it look eortless. These classes,
on the other hand, do us some good, as we do not get to copy someone if we need to.
On weekdays the school gives us work, which I sometimes nd overwhelming, but it is
more work on their side, so that is impressive. Another thing I like is the kind of eort the
teachers are making to teach us by newer methods like making videos of concepts and
even dance steps, so hats o to them for that!
On days when we do have homework, my parents when home check it, which is good
because after the tiring day at work they still spend time with us.
Out of the many things I have learned during the lockdown, one main thing is that my parents
keep reminding through their example that we should keep hope and stay positive.

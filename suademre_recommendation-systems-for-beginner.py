# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed

# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python

# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 



import numpy as np # linear algebra

import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)



# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory



import os

print(os.listdir("../input"))



# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
# import movie data set and look at columns

movie = pd.read_csv("../input/movie.csv")

movie.columns
# what we need is that movie id and title

movie = movie.loc[:,["movieId","title"]]

movie.head(10)
# import rating data and look at columsn

rating = pd.read_csv("../input/rating.csv")

rating.columns
# what we need is that user id, movie id and rating

rating = rating.loc[:,["userId","movieId","rating"]]

rating.head(10)
# then merge movie and rating data

data = pd.merge(movie,rating)
# now lets look at our data 

data.head(10)
data.shape
data = data.iloc[:1000000,:]
# lets make a pivot table in order to make rows are users and columns are movies. And values are rating

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

# carwidth, carheight, curbweight, enginesize, boreratio, horsepower, citympg, highwaympg as finalfeatures. 
# Since our target variable is price, look at last row and see it correlation with all other features. I have considered 
# feature as my finalFeatures if they have correlation > 0.55

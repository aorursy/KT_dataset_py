# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory
import os
import json 

path = "../input/android_malware_2017_dynamic/dynamic/"
files = os.listdir(path)
for file in files[:1]:
    id = file.split('.')[0]
    print(f'id: {id}')
    fqn = path + file
    print(f'path: {fqn}')
    with open(fqn) as f:
        data = json.load(f)

        api_calls = json.loads(api_calls_array)
        print(f'sample content: {api_calls[9]}')

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

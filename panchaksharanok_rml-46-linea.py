# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed

# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python

# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 



import numpy as np # linear algebra

import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)



# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory



import os

for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):

    for filename in filenames:

        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))



# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
#Step 2 : Data import

# Use pandas to read in csv file

#os.chdir(r'C:\Panchu\Machine learning\test)

train = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/housesalesprediction/kc_house_data.csv')

#this is just a comment

train.head(5)
train.dtypes
#Step 5.1: Prepare input X parameters/features and output y



# Split data into 'X' features and 'y' target label sets

X = train[['bedrooms', 'price', 'floors']]

y = train['sqft_living']
#Step 5.2: Split data into Train and test



# Import module to split dataset

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split data set into training and test sets

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=100)
#Step 6 : Run the model



# Import model for fitting

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create instance (i.e. object) of LogisticRegression

#model = LogisticRegression()



#You can try follwoing variation on above model, above is just default one

model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model using the training data

# X_train -> parameter supplies the data features

# y_train -> parameter supplies the target labels

output_model=model.fit(X_train, y_train)

#output =X_test

#output['vehicleTypeId'] = y_test

output_model
import pickle

pkl_filename = "pickle_model.pkl"

with open(pkl_filename, 'wb') as file:

    pickle.dump(model, file)



# Load from file

with open(pkl_filename, 'rb') as file:

    pickle_model = pickle.load(file)



# Calculate the accuracy score and predict target values

score = pickle_model.score(X_test, y_test)

print("Test score: {0:.2f} %".format(100 * score))

Ypredict = pickle_model.predict(X_test)
